# Using Ruby I created these methods:

  1. Caesar Cipher – Shifts letters in a string based on a numeric input.  
  2. Substring – Detects and counts occurrences of dictionary words in a given text.
  3. Stockpicker – Picks the best buy and sell days to get maximum profit.
  4. Bubblesort – Check the alternate numbers one by one and swap them till all numers in array are in ascending order
